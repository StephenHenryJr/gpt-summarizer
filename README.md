Let's explore the key components of the repository.

Key Files
1. gpt_summarizer/gpt.py
This file contains the implementation of the GPTSummarizer class, which utilizes the GPT model for text summarization. The class provides methods to train the model, generate summaries, and save/load model checkpoints. It also uses the Hugging Face transformers library for GPT model integration.

2. gpt_summarizer/utils.py
The utils.py file contains utility functions used by the GPTSummarizer class. These functions handle data preprocessing, tokenization, and batching for training the GPT model.

3. tests/test_gpt.py
The test_gpt.py file contains unit tests for the functionality of the GPTSummarizer class. It ensures that the key operations of the GPT model, such as training and summary generation, work as expected.
